## A learning path

I'm always trying to learn something new. Now i want to learn a bit of game coding during my free time.\
Anyway, everyone who want to help this little game to be better: you are welcome.

There are certein rules, though!

- Comment everything

   As i said, i'm learning, so please help me and the other people like me commenting everything you did! :)
- Keep things playable

   I would like to keep this little, free, open-source game playable by other people, so keep in mind this while adding your new features.
- Tolerate me
